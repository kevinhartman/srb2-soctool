<h1 align="center">soctool (for SRB2)</h1>
A CLI tool designed to assist in the porting of SOC (Sonic Object Configuration) files.

Given valid SOC, emits valid SOC (or Lua!).

## Features
- **Port mode.** Automatically migrate old SOC files that use hard-coded slot numbers to freeslots, making them portable.
- **Generate Lua.** Upgrade SOC definitions to Lua.
- **Dependency info.** Generates a listing of all external references made by the SOC, as well as required asset files.
- **Selection and extraction.** Recursively extract only specific entities (by ID), as well as their local dependencies.

# Usage

## Selectors
All SOC input first must pass the selectors to be further processed.

Selectors (`--<entity>--ids`) filter the input SOC to only the desired entities (and by default, their local dependencies and freeslot declarations). `soctool` discards entities that don't match one of the selectors (they will not be processed, and will not appear in the output).

Selectors are useful for extracting specific entities from an otherwise unwieldy SOC.

They are **additive** filters: the more IDs you specify, the more you will select. You can combine them to select groups of unrelated entities, or omit them entirely to read and process the entire SOC.

To achieve *subtractive* filtering, chain multiple invocations of `soctool` together (pipe I/O).

## Port mode
In port mode (`--make-portable`), any selected entity definitions that install themselves to hard-coded slots (e.g. `Object 230`, `State 1041`, `Sound 150`) will be migrated to generated freeslots. Further, any hard-coded sprite IDs referenced by a selected state will also be allocated freeslots, as long as at least one referencing state will migrate to a freeslot as well.

Freeslot names (constants) are generated by combining the appropriate prefix for the resource type with as much of the user-provided freeslot prefix (`--freeslot-prefix`) as possible, followed by the original hard-coded slot number. The original slot number is included to guarantee uniqueness within the selection, and to help porters understand what's been migrated from where.

For example, if `--freeslot-prefix` is `GHOUL`:

| type   | slot | freeslot    |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Object | 123  | MT_GHOUL123 |
| State  | 2443 | S_GHOUL2443 |
| Sound  | 433  | sfx_gho433  |
| Sprite | 231  | SPR_GH6F    |

Note that for spites, the slot number is base-36 encoded, due its 4 character limit.

#### Important
After porting SOC entities, be sure to examine the dependency listing to determine which asset files are expected by the ported code.

## Dependency listing
By default, the generated output (SOC or Lua code) includes a listing of all external references and required assets. If your output is missing dependencies from the original input SOC file, they will be listed as external references here, along with any other external references. The listing includes:

#### External <entity> references
Any references to entities not declared in the output. This includes hard-coded slot IDs (unless they have been overridden within the selection).

#### Required sound files
Any sound file names expected by the output.

#### Required sprite files
Any sprite file names expected, excluding the rotation. Rotation is omitted because not all sprites need files for all rotations. For more information on this, see [Sprites](https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Sprite).

#### Linedef executors
The IDs of any Linedef executors called.

## Arguments
This section describes the available command-line arguments. They're separated into two categories below only to help you find what you need.

### Selector arguments
These arguments filter the input SOC to only the listed entities (and by default, their local dependencies).

They are **additive** filters: the more IDs you specify, the more you will select.

| arg                           | short | type   | description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--no-recurse`                | -R    | flag   | Select only the entities identified, without recursively selecting their dependencies. Only applicable if at least one entity selector argument is specified. |
| `--object-ids <id>[,<id>]...` | -o    | csv    | Select these objects.                                                                                                                                         |
| `--state-ids <id>[,<id>]...`  | -s    | csv    | Select these states.                                                                                                                                          |
| `--sound-ids <id>[,<id>]...`  | -d    | csv    | Select these sounds.                                                                                                                                          |
| `--level-ids <id>[,<id>]...`  | -l    | csv    | Select these levels.                                                                                                                                          |

### Action arguments
These arguments specify the processing behavior to apply to the selection.

| arg                    | short | type   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--input-soc`          | -i    | path   | When provided, the input SOC's contents will be read from this file instead of `STDIN`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--make-portable`      | -p    | flag   | When provided, all selected SOC entity definitions using hard-coded slots will be upgraded to freeslots. Any local references (within the selection) will also be upgraded to point to the new freeslot locations.                                                                                                                                    |
| `--freeslot-prefix`    | -f    | string | When in port mode (`--make-portable`), specifies a friendly name prefix to use for generated freeslot names. As much of this prefix will be used as possible, though due to length restrictions for certain slot types, it will likely be truncated. For best results, provide at most 4 characters that will help you to identify related entities.  |
| `--to-lua`             | -S    | flag   | Emit results as Lua code. Keep in mind that this tool cannot read Lua, so if you plan to do multiple passes by chaining invocations, save this parameter for your final invocation.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--from-old-srb2`      | -u    | flag   | [Not very useful at the moment] Attempt to upgrade old versions of actions (e.g. if they've been renamed or had parameter changes). Currently, this just changes A_RingExplode calls to A_OldRingExplode if the state's `var1` contains an object ID.                                                                                                 |
| `--no-describe`        | -D    | flag   | Omit the default block comment with dependency information from the output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `--no-inline-comments` | -I    | flag   | Suppress the generation of warnings as inline comments. Inline comments are generated by default with information specific to particular entities that `soctool` thinks may be helpful to porters. Once you're done porting, this flag might be a good idea for a final pass to clean things up.                                                      |
| `--no-attribution`     | -A    | flag   | Suppress the generation of the attribution message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--help`               | -?    | flag   | Print the help text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Prerequisite software
`soctool` is written in Scala, and therefore requires the JVM to run.
